Created with CodeSandbox

### Layout description
- The homepage is a starting point for our site and includes a more general overview of current health news, also categorizing into Women, Men and Children
Our other 2 pages focus on Mental Health and Innovation in Health 

- 3 pages that have a consistent look, for example the banner running across the top of each page, but have subtle differences to keep them individual 

- Main feature of website = embedded podcasts (radiopublic.com) lucky to find this as it gave the format of our website more shape. 

- Also have links to news stories, articles and other resources.

- We didnâ€™t want to exclude any groups so have tried to make it accessible for hard of hearing viewers - links to transcribed podcasts and videos with subtitles
Making it more mobile friendly, the first link on homepage will open Spotify App when opens on a mobile device

### Styling description
Starting at the top:
- 2 Navigations - news website theme
- In-line Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn icons - https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/
- Logo - looka.com (consistent with the theme)
- Banner Header (use of carousel captions) over images - colourful, attention grabbing, more likely to read text over image (against plain background). Keep the user on our website.
- Black border separating each section (border-top) - similar to news themed websites (padding)
- Faded grey box - to avoid changing the text colour on each page (4 pages) rgba 
- Bootstrap card - make the website look 3D and mini headlines standout 
- Media queries - changed font-size (carousel captions) to be mobile - friendly 
- Form modal for inquiries about our website
